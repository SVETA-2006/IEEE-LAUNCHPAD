I’m an Electronics and Communication Engineering student who loves learning about how technology works.
I'm interested in circuits, communication systems, and new innovations that help connect people and devices.

I believe I meet the requirements for being a leader and influencer in my domain through my ability to take initiative, support my peers, and guide teams toward a common goal.
I have showed leadership while working as a team member in our Professional Communication subject project. 
I actively helped my teammates understand the requirements, shared ideas, and supported them in preparing content and organizing our presentation.

To influence and lead others, I focus on being supportive and sharing what I know. Whether it's helping a friend understand a topic or guiding a team through a project, I aim to lead by example.
In the future, I hope to inspire others by working on meaningful tech solutions and encouraging students like me to explore, create, and stay curious.
